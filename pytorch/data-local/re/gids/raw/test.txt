/m/03tjz7	/m/08x2xq	John_Peel	Caldbeck	NA	John_Peel was born at Park End, near Caldbeck , Cumberland; his family moved a short time after to the Greenrigg farm. He was baptised on 24 September 1777, but most sources suggest he was born the previous year. Peel married in 1797 to Mary White. Some of the White family's property at Ruthwaite (near Ireby) passed into his hands, which secured Peel a comfortable income. However, he was, as many of his friends admitted, prone to dissipation and he devoted himself primarily to hunting. Peel was a farmer by profession, and kept a pack of fox hounds. Peel hunted pine martens and hares, in addition to foxes. By the end of his life (13 November 1854, most likely due to a fall while hunting) he had accrued large debts, which his friends helped him pay off. ###END###

/m/01g71_	/m/01b8w_	Giovanni_Battista_Cipriani	Hammersmith	/people/deceased_person/place_of_death	Some of his best work is the decoration of furniture. He designed many groups, of nymphs and amorini and medallion subjects to form the centre of Pergolesi's bands of ornament, and they were continually reproduced upon the elegant satin-wood furniture which was growing popular in his later days and by the end of the 18th century became a rage. Sometimes these designs were inlaid in marqueterie, but most frequently they were painted upon the satin-wood by other hands with delightful effect, since in the whole range of English furniture there is nothing more enchanting than really good finished satin-wood pieces. There can be little doubt that some of the beautiful furniture designed by the Adams was actually painted by Giovanni_Battista_Cipriani himself. He also occasionally designed handles for drawers and doors. Cipriani died at Hammersmith and was buried at Chelsea, where Bartolozzi erected a monument to his memory. He had married an English lady, by whom he had two sons. ###END###

/m/0gtyc2h	/m/0k3p	Nicolaes_de_Bruyn	Amsterdam	/people/deceased_person/place_of_death	Nicolaes_de_Bruyn was the son of Abraham De Bruyn, and was born at Antwerp about 1570. Although he was instructed by his father in engraving, he did not follow his example, either in the style of his execution, or in the size of his plates. He appears to have studied and to have formed his manner from the works of Lucas van Leyden. His compositions are abundant, but he wanted taste in the selection of his forms. He finished his plates very neatly with the graver; but there is not much effect in his prints, from his ignorance of the management of the chiaroscuro. Notwithstanding this defect, which was very general at the time in which he lived, his works possess considerable merit. He died at Amsterdam in 1656. He signed his plates sometimes with his initials N. de B., and sometimes with a monogram. ###END###
